\section{Conclusions}%
\label{sec:conclusions}
The results of this work are highly impacted by the lack of statistics. We ran three simulations, each 2 orders of magnitude
smaller than the one in the reference article, on the lattices with smaller physical volume and larger spacing. This particularly
afflicted the distribution of $Q$, which in this work were not normally distributed on the integers around $0$, and ultimately
the wellness of the continuum limit fit of $t_{0}\chi^{2}$.
Still, given the relative novelty of the techniques and definitions that were used, a qualitatively correct result is a strong statement
about the potential of this line of research.
