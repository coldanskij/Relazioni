  We computed the mass of the $\eta'$ meson using the Witten Veneziano formula accounting for $3$ quark flavors.
  We simulated an $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory with Wilsonian discretization on three lattices with fixed physical volume and progressively finer spacing,
  from which we estimated the continuum limit of the topological susceptibility $\chi$.
  We considered a naive discretization to define the topological charge density $q^{t}$, which we evolved with the Wilson flow, to compute its
  cumulants $Q^{t}$ and $t_{0}^2\chi^{t}$ at a reference time $t_{0}$.
  Due to the lack of statistics, our best results were only qualitatively correct.
