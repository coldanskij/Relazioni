\section{Physical results}%
\label{sec:physicalresults}
In this section we report the results of the simulation.
We start discussing the lattice results for the correlation functions, along with their error and noise to signal ratio, then we present the energy gap $\DEt$
and the matrix element; finally, we show the continuum limit
extrapolations. The physical parameters $m$ and $\omega$ were both fixed at $1$ for every lattice and time $t$ is in units of the spacing $a$.
%In this section we show that we were able to numerically recover the physical results for the harmonic oscillator.
%Keeping the same parameters of table \ref{tab:A3} we will discuss the correlation functions and their error, then
%the discrete values of the energy gap $\DEt$ and matrix element $\matb$ and finally the continuum limit.
