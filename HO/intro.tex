\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:Introduction}
The harmonic oscillator is likely the simplest physical system that is also worth studying. Despite said simplicity, a deep understanding of the harmonic oscillator is the key to understand complex topics such  as classical mechanics and quantum field theory.

The path integral approach is particularly relevant in computational physics, as it provides the\\ blueprint for the study of quantum field theories on the lattice.
The steps taken to compute the energy gap between the ground and the first excited state of the harmonic oscillator are the same ones that are
required to compute the mass of the lightest particle with a particular set of quantum numbers of a given theory -- \textit{e.g.}
the proton in QCD -- and the results present the great advantage of being able to be confronted with known analytical values, both
on the lattice and in the continuum.
This allows us to verify that the lattice numerical resolution, which we implemented with Monte Carlo techniques, is correct in both cases.
