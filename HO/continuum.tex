We used the data gathered in tables \ref{tab:energyresults} and \ref{tab:matrixresults} to extract the physical properties of the continuum harmonic oscillator.
For both the energy gap and the matrix elements, according to equations \ref{eqn:fullen} and \ref{eqn:fullmat}, we performed a linear fit $y = m a ^2+q$ to find
$\Delta\tilde{E} = 0.9998(5)$ and $\matb = 0.4998(3)$ as the interception with the $y$ axis. The results are in good agreement with the theoretical values of $1$ and $0.5$.

Figures \ref{fig:contenergy} and \ref{fig:contmatelem} report the continuum limit for $\DEt$ and $\matb$ respectively, while figures \ref{fig:enerzoom} and \ref{fig:matzoom}
show close-ups of the points near the origin.

We also performed a \textit{full fit} those same equations to recover the frequency $\omega$ and the mass $m$ of the oscillator.
The results were satisfactory for the fit on $\DEt$, which had $\omega$ and $A$ as parameters
\begin{align}
  \DEt = \omega - \frac{\omega^{3}}{A}a^{2},
\end{align}
while the results for $\matb$ were less good. The model we used was
\begin{align}
  \matb = \frac{1}{2m\w}- \frac{\omega}{16 m}a^{2}
\end{align}
with $\w$ and $m$ as the fit parameters. Their values differ
from the expected ones by $8$ and $9$ standard deviations, but the correlation matrix suggests a very large negative correlation
between the fit parameters, which is not present in the theory
\begin{align}
  \label{eqn:cov}
  \crr =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & -0.999\\
    -0.999 & 1\\
  \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}

The results are collected in tables \ref{tab:entab} and \ref{tab:mattab}.
