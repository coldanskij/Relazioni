  We solved the 1D quantum harmonic oscillator with the lattice path integral approach through numerical techniques. By generating Feynman paths using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method and exploring various lattice configurations, we computed the energy difference and position operator matrix element between the ground state and the first excited state.
  The best results were $\DEt = 0.9998(5)$ and $\matb=0.4998(3)$ for theoretical values of
  $1$ and $0.5$.
  The calculations were conducted on five lattices of progressively smaller spacing, whose results were extrapolated to the continuum with linear fits. In addition, our analysis focused on general features of Monte Carlo simulations of quantum theories.
